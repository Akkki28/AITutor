# AITutor
An adaptive learning system using DQN to optimize personalized learning paths.By dynamically adjusting the content difficulty and learning strategy based on the studentâ€™s performance, the system optimizes learning outcomes Leveraged custom reward structures and state transitions to ensure efficient agent convergence and improved learning outcomes.

# Working
The model takes in latent traits of the student as input, and provides a suitable learning resource based on the characterization provided by the latent traits. after completion the students latent traits get updated and are fed back into the model. This process is repeated until a goal state is acheived.
